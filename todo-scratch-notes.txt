cutilExit
bind / map texture
load triangles
fix xyz directions
get FPS
load obj normals
per vertex normals
barycentric interp
path trace
film memory
FIX NOW : BUG : ray intersection, distortion
do Karl's 2 buffers - DOES NOT WORK
spheres and cube
jitter within pixel - already did that
color bleeding
- there are depth 2 paths
  - has not hit light before (at d=1)
- no depth 2 paths end at light
- fixed with rand index cycling

-----

stream compaction?

object picking / moving

focal blur - seems to be more vertical
- when swap A and B result different

fix fresnel for cubes
- EPS problem?
- ray bounce double intersect? store prim/face ID?

normal un-transform incorrectly with non-uniform scaling?

exit / cleanup CUDA correctly?

optimize intersections
use tmin for intersection comparison

wave-front kernels

kd-tree: obj tree, scene tree

bug: obj loader need endline at end of .obj file
